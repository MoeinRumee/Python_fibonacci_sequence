# Python_fibonacci_sequence

You are whooshing in with a brain-bender, spacetrooper! Have you ever heard about the Fibonacci sequence, starting with 0 and 1, each number being the sum of the preceding two? Now, imagine blasting off from 2 and 3 instead, isn't that galactic? In this task, I want you to construct a function that takes an integer n and parachutes back with the n-th number in our ship-shaped Fibonacci sequence. Just a tiny reminder: your indexing starts at 0, and the function must return the n-th element in the sequence.

Watch out for the black holes, Galactic Pioneer! The input n can be any integer from 0 and onwards, and the output should be a single integer, the n-th element in our turbocharged Fibonacci sequence. Remember, no fear! I believe in you, Voyager! Keep reaching for the stars!
